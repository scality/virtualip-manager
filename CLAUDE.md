# CLAUDE.md
Working guide for virtualip-manager. The project's documentation is imported below so it is always in context — read it and follow it instead of rediscovering the conventions each time.

- Usage, flags, and behavior: @README.md
- Architecture, the sync model, and design decisions: @DESIGN.md
- Workflow and coding conventions: @CONTRIBUTING.md

## Keep the docs in sync
The docs are part of every change, not an afterthought. In the same PR, update the doc that owns what you changed:

- behavior, flags, or output → @README.md
- architecture or a design decision → @DESIGN.md
- conventions or workflow → @CONTRIBUTING.md

If a change contradicts something written in these docs, fix the docs rather than leaving them stale.
